**Hello,** my name is *Lucy Gai* and I am a Computer Science student at ~~Zoom University~~ **The University of California, _San Diego_.**

A Pierre Omidyar quote:
> We have technology, finally, that for the first time in human history allows people to really maintain rich connections with much larger numbers of people.

(This quote was found from [this Bloomberg article](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2005-06-19/online-extra-pierre-omidyar-on-connecting-people).)

Part of why I chose to major in CS was due to my interest in how technology has helped broaden connections with people all over the world. Even in a pandemic we still can communicate and connect, even if at most through a screen. 

Although it does get repetitive at times.

```
void daily_routine() {
    eat();
    zoom();
    eat();
    zoom();
    study();
    sleep();
}
```
